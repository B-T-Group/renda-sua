In this file I describe general rules to follow.

## General Rules

- Do not have methods that are more that 20 lines of code

## General Backend Rules

These rules apply to the backend application

- Only generate controller paths if explicitely mentioned

## General Frontend Rules

- Always use material UI styling
- For requests, create doman specific react hooks
- Prioritize mordern standards and making components beautiful
- Create all hooks under a hooks directory in src/hooks
- always use React best practices

## Hasura Rules

- always track tables created
- whenever applying hasura migrations, always provide hasura admin secret myadminsecretkey
- **IMPORTANT**: This project uses Hasura for database management, NOT Supabase
- Never use `supabase` CLI commands - use `hasura` commands instead
- See hasura-migrations.mdc for detailed migration rules
