- **`useDocumentManagement`** - Manages document data, filtering, and CRUD operations

### **2. Components**

- **`DocumentUpload`** - Full-featured upload component with validation and progress
- **`SimpleDocumentUpload`** - Compact version for forms and smaller contexts
- **`DocumentList`** - Comprehensive document management interface
- **`DocumentManagementPage`** - Main page combining all functionality

### **3. Integration Points**

- **Routing** - Added `/documents` route to app.tsx
