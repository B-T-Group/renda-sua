# Translation Keys Restructure Summary

## Date

October 9, 2025

## Overview

Successfully restructured translation files (`en.json` and `fr.json`) to match the exact key structure used in the codebase, eliminating mismatches and duplicates.

## Process Summary

### Step 1: Key Extraction

- Scanned **221 TypeScript/TSX files** in the frontend codebase
- Extracted **1,205 unique translation keys** used in code
- Captured default values from `t()` function calls

### Step 2: Existing Translation Parsing

- Parsed existing `en.json`: **988 translations**
- Parsed existing `fr.json`: **872 translations**
- Created flat mappings for value preservation

### Step 3: Structure Building

- Built new nested structure based on keys from code
- Used **simplest nesting** matching code patterns (e.g., `business.cancel` → `{ business: { cancel: "..." } }`)
- Removed unnecessary nesting levels (like "general" wrappers)
- Sorted keys alphabetically at each level for maintainability

### Step 4: Value Mapping

#### English (en.json)

- **Preserved translations**: 790 (65.6%)
- **New from defaults**: 359 (29.8%)
- **Missing defaults**: 56 (4.6%) - marked as "TODO: Add translation"

#### French (fr.json)

- **Preserved translations**: 673 (55.9%)
- **Used English as placeholder**: 532 (44.1%)

### Step 5: File Generation

- Created backups:
  - `en.backup-2025-10-09T21-30-37-795Z.json`
  - `fr.backup-2025-10-09T21-30-37-795Z.json`
- Generated new files with proper formatting (2-space indentation)
- Both files: **1,459 lines** each

## Key Improvements

### Fixed Nesting Issues

Previously, some keys had incorrect nesting. Examples fixed:

1. **Orders Structure**

   - Created proper `orders.agent.actionRequired.*` structure
   - Created proper `orders.business.actionRequired.*` structure
   - Created proper `orders.client.actionRequired.*` structure

2. **Resolved Conflicts**
   - Converted 2 keys from strings to objects to support nested structures:
     - `orders.agent` (had nested `actionRequired` keys)
     - `orders.business` (had nested `actionRequired` keys)

### Eliminated Duplicates

- Removed redundant keys that existed in multiple nesting levels
- Unified similar translations under consistent paths

## Orphaned Keys

### English

- **198 orphaned keys** found (not used in current code)
- Top examples:
  - `common.showDetails`
  - `common.hideDetails`
  - `common.created`
  - `common.welcomeBack`
  - `common.orderStatus.pending_payment`
  - `common.orderStatus.complete`
  - `common.orderStatus.unknown`
  - And 191 more...

### French

- **199 orphaned keys** found

**Note**: These orphaned keys were excluded from the new translation files since they're not referenced in the code. They're preserved in the backup files if needed later.

## Statistics

| Metric                        | Count | Percentage |
| ----------------------------- | ----- | ---------- |
| Total keys in code            | 1,205 | 100%       |
| Keys with preserved EN values | 790   | 65.6%      |
| Keys with preserved FR values | 673   | 55.9%      |
| New keys from code defaults   | 359   | 29.8%      |
| Keys needing translation      | 56    | 4.6%       |
| Orphaned keys removed         | ~198  | N/A        |

## What Changed

### Structure Examples

**Before** (incorrect nesting):

```json
{
  "general": {
    "business": {
      "cancel": "Cancel"
    }
  }
}
```

**After** (correct nesting):

```json
{
  "business": {
    "cancel": "Cancel"
  }
}
```

**Before** (flat when should be nested):

```json
{
  "orders": {
    "agent": "Agent",
    "business": "Business"
  }
}
```

**After** (properly nested):

```json
{
  "orders": {
    "agent": {
      "actionRequired": {
        "in_transit": "Action Required: Update delivery status",
        "picked_up": "Action Required: Start delivery",
        "ready_for_pickup": "Action Required: Claim this order"
      }
    },
    "business": {
      "actionRequired": {
        "delivered": "Action Required: Complete order",
        "pending": "Action Required: Confirm this order",
        "preparing": "Action Required: Complete preparation"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Files Modified

- ✅ `/apps/frontend/src/i18n/locales/en.json` - Restructured with 1,205 keys
- ✅ `/apps/frontend/src/i18n/locales/fr.json` - Restructured with 1,205 keys

## Backup Files

Original files backed up to:

- `/apps/frontend/src/i18n/locales/en.backup-2025-10-09T21-30-37-795Z.json`
- `/apps/frontend/src/i18n/locales/fr.backup-2025-10-09T21-30-37-795Z.json`

## Next Steps

### Immediate

1. ✅ Translation files are ready to use
2. ✅ All keys from code are present in both files
3. ✅ Backups available for reference

### Future Tasks

1. **French Translations**: Review and translate the 532 keys currently using English as placeholders
2. **Missing Defaults**: Add translations for 56 keys marked as "TODO: Add translation"
3. **Code Review**: Verify all translation keys work correctly in the application
4. **Orphaned Keys**: Review the 198 orphaned keys - determine if any should be added back

## Validation

To validate the restructure was successful:

```bash
# Check file structure
cat apps/frontend/src/i18n/locales/en.json | jq 'keys' | head -20

# Search for a specific key
cat apps/frontend/src/i18n/locales/en.json | jq '.orders.agent.actionRequired'

# Verify key count
cat apps/frontend/src/i18n/locales/en.json | jq 'paths | length'
```

## Conclusion

The translation restructure was completed successfully. All 1,205 translation keys used in the codebase are now present in both `en.json` and `fr.json` with:

- ✅ Correct nested structure matching code
- ✅ Preserved existing translations where possible
- ✅ Alphabetically sorted for easy maintenance
- ✅ Backup files for safety
- ✅ Clean, consistent structure

The application should now have consistent translation key access without mismatches.
